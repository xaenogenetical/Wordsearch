This program is a wordsearch generator. To begin, call 'make' then execute searcher.o with at least 2 args.

Argument 1 is a positive integer <= 20. 

Following args are single words ('cheese' or 'flying' not 'big truck').

searcher.o will generate an arg1 x arg1 grid, place the provided words into the grid at a random position and angle, then fill the remainder of the grid with random letters
If a word cannot be fit into the grid, the program will print a message explaining this and then exit with code 1;
The program will also exit with code 1 if duplicate words are provided on the command line. Only one of each word (case-insensitive) can be inserted into the puzzle.
