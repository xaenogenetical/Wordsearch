1/21/25 Began project, 
        laid out intitial variables in main
1/22/25 defined ints assigned to the direction of the words,
        set up framework in main to call fit_into_puzzle method
1/23/25 Began constructing fit_into_puzzle,
        set up a randomized initial position for finding a spot for each word
        Created Makefile
1/24/25 added a piece to main to ensure that all words entered on the command line are converted to lowercase,
        created function to place the word into the puzzle 
            at the location found by fit_into_puzzle by finding an empty angle to place the word at (find_angle_for), added fill_grid and print_grid to fill the empty spaces with random chars
        and print the grid to console respectively, updated fit_into_puzzle to have a more concise method of iterating through the grid
        ERROR: Encountered a fatal error where the program does not run when more than one argument is passed on the command line. not sure of the reason, working to debug
        Woke up in the morning, i tried to assign a value to a variable using == instead of =, fixed that, but now the find_angle_for method apparently does not actually put the
            word in the puzzle, I'm gonna lose it
        Turns out i must have messed up my method of placing words in, as it only seems to place the first letter, will investigate
        I'm actually losing it this time. I placed the return statement inside the for loop so the program returned at the end of the first loop instead of after completing the
            whole loop. Good news is the program seems to work now, it places the whole words in the array.
        Added a check to ensure that no duplicate command line arguments, which prevents more than one of the same word from being added to the puzzle
        Added a loop to convert all words to lowercase before inserting in order to prevent cheesing the puzzle by using capital letters
        Performed final bug testing
        Created README
        Modified Makefile to include 'make clean'
        Updated README
